<h1>304 | Facial Recognition System </h1>

[Github Repo](https://github.com/flappybird1084/rianb_BSE_Template_Portfolio/tree/gh-pages)

<h2>Starter Project</h2>
My starter project was Weevil Eyes. In this project, I soldered a couple individual components onto a circuit board. 
The end product is a tiny device with LEDs and a photoresistor that lights up when it senses a lack of light around it. 
This works with a battery providing power to LEDs and a transistor blocking the flow of power until the photoresistor resists nothing. This typically occurs when there is no light falling on it. 

<img src = "IMG_5561.jpeg" width = "250" height = "300">

<h2>Main Project</h2>
In this project, I will design a facial recognition system. 
Some major libraries were required for this process: facenet-pytorch, and pytorch. I also needed to reconfigure the python environments on my laptop with pyenv, as python had been installed on homebrew which blocked some libaries from being installed.
The main plan is as such: Take an image, isolate the most prominent face in it, and run image recognition <b>only on the face.</b>

<h2>Code</h2>

This project was very code-intensive. First, I had to take pictures using the OpenCV python library and save them to a specified path on my computer.
```
## Original source from here:
## https://realpython.com/face-detection-in-python-using-a-webcam/

import cv2
import time

video_capture = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
folder = "./img/train/notrian/"

while True:
    #print("loop started")
    # Capture frame-by-frame
    ret, frame = video_capture.read()
    cv2.imshow('Video', frame)
    key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xff
    if key == ord('q'):
        print("Exiting...")
        break
    if key  == ord('s'):
        timestr = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") 
        print("Saving image: "+timestr + ".jpeg")
        filename = folder + timestr + ".jpeg"
        cv2.imwrite(filename, frame)
    if key == 13: ## enter key
        timestr = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
        print("Saving image: "+timestr + ".jpeg")
        filename = folder + timestr + ".jpeg"
        cv2.imwrite(filename, frame)

video_capture.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

Then, I needed to isolate all the faces from the pictures and save them separately, as the rest of the image was unnecessary. I ran this program in the form of a python notebook to monitor the code and debug faster, but for convenience have listed it all in a big chunk here.
```
from facenet_pytorch import MTCNN
import torch
import numpy as np
#import mmcv
import cv2
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw
from IPython import display
import os,glob

device = torch.device('cpu')
print('Running on device: {}'.format(device))

mtcnn = MTCNN(keep_all=True, device=device)

path = "/Users/rianbutala/Rian's projects/Coding/Facial Recognition/img/train/rian"
save_path = "/Users/rianbutala/Rian's projects/Coding/Facial Recognition/cropped/train/rian"

os.chdir(path)

images = []

for file in glob.glob("*.jpeg"):
    with Image.open(file) as img:
        #img.show()
        images.append(file)
print(type(images[0]))


imgs =[]
#print('\rTracking frame: {}'.format(i + 1), end='')

# Detect faces
for count,img in enumerate(images):
    os.chdir(path)
    print(img)
    img = Image.open(img)
    boxes, _ = mtcnn.detect(img)

    # Draw faces
    frame_draw = img.copy()
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(frame_draw)
    try:
        for box in boxes:
            draw.rectangle(box.tolist(), outline=(255, 0, 0), width=6)
            print(box)

        cropped_img = img.copy()
        cropped_img = cropped_img.crop(boxes[0])
        #d = display.display(cropped_img, display_id=True)
        os.chdir(save_path)
        cropped_img.save("img_"+str(count)+".jpeg")
        print("saved!!")


        # Add to frame list
        imgs.append(frame_draw.resize((640, 360), Image.BILINEAR))
        print('\nDone')
    except:
        print("caught!!")


#d = display.display(imgs[0], display_id=True)
for img in imgs:
    display.display(img,display_id=True)

```

After that, I trained the model by transfer learning on resnet-18 (also imported from notebook). I had a lot of trouble trying to use Apple's MPS backend to train the model, as Pytorch had nicer compatibility with CPU and Nvidia CUDA training, but managed to figure it out in the end. 

```
import torch
if torch.backends.mps.is_available():
    mps_device = torch.device("mps")
    x = torch.ones(1, device=mps_device)
    print (x)
else:
    print ("MPS device not found.")

At the end of that file, we save the model as 'model_ft.pt' for later use, and deployment on the Raspberry Pi, as I obviously can't train the model on it. 
Here's a small piece of code that lets me test the trained model on the same set of images.

Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
